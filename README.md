# Space Shooter Game

A classic space shooter game built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game features multiple levels, each progressively increasing in difficulty, where the player controls a spaceship to shoot down enemy ships and avoid obstacles. As the player progresses through levels, the enemies become more aggressive, and random boss encounters add an extra challenge. Each level introduces new enemy types with distinct behaviors and abilities.

## Features:
- **Levels**: The game consists of multiple levels, with increasing difficulty as the player progresses. Each level features a unique set of enemies and obstacles.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points by destroying enemies and completing levels. The score is tracked throughout the game and displayed on the main screen.
- **Boss Battles**: Random boss battles appear at certain points, offering a significant challenge with powerful enemy ships that require strategic planning to defeat.
- **Random Boss Spawns**: Bosses randomly appear at specific intervals or after completing certain milestones, keeping the gameplay fresh and unpredictable.
- **Object-Oriented Structure**: The game is structured around classes that define the behaviors of the spaceship, enemies, projectiles, levels, and game logic, ensuring modular and reusable code.
  
## Gameplay:
- **Player Ship**: The player controls a spaceship that can move across the screen and shoot projectiles. The ship has health, and the player loses if the ship’s health reaches zero.
- **Enemies**: Various types of enemy ships appear throughout the levels. Each enemy has unique behaviors, such as movement patterns and attack strategies.
- **Projectiles**: The player’s spaceship fires projectiles that destroy enemies upon impact. Projectiles have a limited range and speed.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the player’s projectiles and enemy ships, as well as collisions between the player’s ship and enemies or obstacles.
